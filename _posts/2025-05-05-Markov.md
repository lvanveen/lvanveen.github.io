<p>A question that has been on my mind for a while now is how Markovian dynamics can give rise to "flickering noise", i.e. a
power spectrum with (a range of) 1/f like behaviour. Below is an example, loosely based on the game of "snakes and ladders".
Let the output signal be 0 when the state is in cluster 0 and 1 if it is in cluster 1. A simple computation shows that the
probability of residence times is algebraic for cluster 0 and exponential for cluster 1. Thus, the spectrum is that of an
alternating fractal renewal process (see Lowen & Teich's <i>Fractoal-based point processes</i>). Shown are the averaged results
of $4,000$ simulations with 200 "ladders". The truncation of the chain in cluster 1 leads to a truncation of the range
in which flickering noise is observed.</p>
<p>Of course, this example is not very satisfactory because the algebraic decay of the probability distribution is caused
by the hard-coded algebraic decay of the weights coupling the clusters. I have since had better ideas...
