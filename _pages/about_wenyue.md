Wenyue studied several simplified models of cardiac arrhythmia. In particular, we were interested in the bifurcation scenarios that lead from a regular to an irregular heart beat. Since even the simple models are highly nonlinear and have several parameters, Wenyue automated the bifurcation analysis, which required stitching together Fortran (AUTO), Python and Bash scripts. We greatly benefited from our discussions with <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~echerry/">Elizabeth Cherry</a>, now at Georgia Tech.
