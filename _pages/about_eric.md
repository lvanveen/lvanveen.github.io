Eric worked with Yan Fossat of Klick labs and myself on the extraction of biomarkers for type-2 diabetes from data obtained from Continuous Glucose Monitors. Just before his candidacy exam came up, he was offered a job at RBC, one of the bigger banks in Canada, and could not refuse. The second half of his PhD research will be somewhat delayed, but we are working on a re-analysis of the trial data that focuses more on dynamics and less on statistics.
